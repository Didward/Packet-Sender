Multi-Threaded Packet Sender
============================

This repository contains a JavaScript function `sendPackets` that allows you to send multiple packets to a specified URL using multiple threads.

Usage
-----

First, run the [JavaScript code](./code.js) which is a function.

To use this function, simply call `sendPackets` with the following parameters:

    
    sendPackets(url, count);
    

*   `url`: The URL to which the packets should be sent.
*   `count`: The number of packets to send.

How it Works
------------

The `sendPackets` function creates an array of threads, where each thread sends a packet to the specified URL using an XMLHttpRequest. The function utilizes JavaScript's multi-threading capabilities to send multiple packets concurrently.

The process is as follows:

1.  An array called `threads` is created.
2.  A loop runs `count` times, creating a new thread in each iteration. Each thread sends a packet to the URL using an XMLHttpRequest.
3.  After all the threads are created, another loop starts all the threads by calling the `start()` method on each thread.
4.  Finally, the function waits for all the threads to finish using the `join()` method.
